I'm Quanah Zimmerman, a Communications Manager at Université de Liège with +10 years of experience in the field of journalism, PR and digital communication. I make things clear and understandable. 

## Digital strategy 

Truly passionate about the interdependencies of content and form. I build websites for fun. Uploaded my first scrappy html pages back in 1996 and I've been tinkering in the digital space ever since. Became reasonably proficient in designing stuff for the web. Focused on web standards and accessibility. Solid knowledge of WordPress. 

## Graphic design & Photography 

Designed a ton of flyers, brochures and various printed materials. Takes photographs (portfolio). Extensive experience using Adobe Creative Cloud for print and web (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver). Working knowledge of motion graphics software (Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects). Obsessed by legibility and typography nerd.

## Personal trivia 

Dual citizen of the USA and Belgium. Of Scottish and German descent. Ran the 2014 Brussels marathon.
